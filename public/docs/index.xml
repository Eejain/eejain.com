      <description>\(\Bbb{MADE}\enspace\Bbb{BY}\enspace\color{#83A78D}\mathcal{N}\negmedspace\negmedspace\negthickspace{\forall}\)   Who is speaking?  Hi there, this is Eejain.
Many tags can be attached to me: gender-queer, born and raised Chinese, a half-made geek plus self-taught scribbler, a young scholar dangling between publish or perish, and an enthusiast with all things quaint yet profound.
But none of them will stick.
Pared to the bone, I am just a curious soul that wants to share bits and pieces of thoughts with you.</description>
