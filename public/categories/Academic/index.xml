      <description>Citavi  my team is already using this software proprietary, mostly used by German institutions  Prossss  in-app pdf viewer, pretty fast compared to Acrobat, similar with Preview save pdf annotation directly in app embedded todo management powerful note taking system (Quotation) able to preview search result  Con     proprietary, not many users outside Germany (forum discussion mostly in German) only supports windows the transfer and sharing of references between projects is more effortful (import, export) unable to change interface font size, unable to change layout to column and row  Zotero  the reference management tool that I have used the longest and most often  Pros  free, light weight, open source, cross platform active community for Q&amp;amp;A and add-on development able to organize all references in library or in specific &amp;ldquo;Collection&amp;rdquo; better bibtex support  Cons  note taking ability is very limited and simplistic  Current pick 2020-08-26  still using zotero for my personal library, but use Citavi for a cloud project shared with my team (share articles with each other for journal club and journal briefing) importing Zotero bibtex to Citavi issues: no collection, tag, related (article) info  </description>
