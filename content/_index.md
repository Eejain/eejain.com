## Who is speaking? {#who-is-speaking}
---
I am a researcher trying to understand teachers' cognitive and emotional experience. 


I conduct experiments in physical and virtual reality. I work with a diverse set of data sources that go beyond the teachers' visible behaviors and self-reports, such as their eye movements, heart rates, and physical movement. 

I'm currently a postdoc at the University of Potsdam, Germany.

<!-- Hi there, this is Eejain. -->

<!-- Many tags can be attached to me: a young scholar dangling between publish or perish, a half-made geek plus self-taught scribbler,  and an enthusiast with all things quaint yet profound. -->

<!-- But none of them will stick. -->

<!-- Pared to the bone, I am just a **curious** soul that wants to share bits and pieces of thoughts with you. -->

<!-- This a collection of short essays on subculture, media, and human mind. They are possibly opinionated but guaranteed to be honest. And on the flip side, I avoid documenting brief passing thoughts, egocentric fantasies, and plain life events. Those writings can be better approached by using social media, personal journal, and a good old diary. -->

<!-- This virtual folio starts as a serious writing practice outside academia, an earnest attempt to speak in my real voice about things that resonates with me. Things that maybe trivial and obscure, but at one point, rippled through my stream of consciousness and finds their niche. -->

<!-- So it flows.&nbsp;[^1] -->
