## Citavi {#citavi}

-   my team is already using this software
-   proprietary, mostly used by German institutions


### Prossss {#prossss}

-   in-app pdf viewer, pretty fast compared to Acrobat, similar with Preview
-   save pdf annotation directly in app
-   embedded todo management
-   powerful note taking system (Quotation)
-   able to preview search result


### Con {#con}

-


-   proprietary, not many users outside Germany (forum discussion mostly in German)
-   only supports windows
-   the transfer and sharing of references between projects is more effortful (import, export)
-   unable to change interface font size, unable to change layout to column and row


## Zotero {#zotero}

-   the reference management tool that I have used the longest and most often


### Pros {#pros}

-   free, light weight, open source, cross platform
-   active community for Q&A and add-on development
-   able to organize all references in library or in specific "Collection"
-   better bibtex support


### Cons {#cons}

-   note taking ability is very limited and simplistic


### Current pick 2020-08-26 {#current-pick-2020-08-26}

-   still using zotero for my personal library, but use Citavi for a cloud project shared with my team (share articles with each other for journal club and journal briefing)
-   importing Zotero bibtex to Citavi issues: no collection, tag, related (article) info
