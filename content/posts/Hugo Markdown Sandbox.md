|  VR | visual saliency | scanpath pattern | predictive | In VR environment, can we predict teacher's eye movement patteren by the visual saliency of the classroom combined with their different level/type of expertise/knowledge? | essentially, what drives teacher's attention? |
|   | teacher characteristics |  |  |  |  |
|   | task properties |  |  | can we predict fixation allocation by saliency in different component of teaching? |  |
