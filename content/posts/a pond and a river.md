I pondered a lot about the pale thin limbs of hers, of curves that blends into mine. <br />
I coil around her eyes possessed of a deepest black, <br />
soaked with the obsessive fixation on outcry. <br />
Yet her blood from screaming is asphalt grey. <br />
It's greying, it's the grass by the pond. <br />
I am in love with her sudden burst of emotion of unknown origin. <br />
Deep in the furs,  <br />
a pair of blood-filled eyes in pride and intransigence, <br />
still more, <br />
with sorrow that arise at the sight of unnamed rivers, topped with cremated foam and mossy algae. <br />
Singsongly she said: <br />
A Buddha was buried here, together with a secret pact with the wind.
